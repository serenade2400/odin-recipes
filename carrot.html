    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This carrot cake recipe with a homemade cream cheese frosting is my favorite, and I have tried many carrot cakes! It's moist, easy to make with grated carrots, and so delicious! 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sugars: You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Eggs: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Vanilla: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carrots: Of course, you'll need grated carrots!
        </li>
        <li>
            Pecans: Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Butter and cream cheese: Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make the batter: Beat the wet ingredients together, then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir in the carrots and fold in the pecans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the cake: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan or pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.
        </li>
        <li>
            Frost the cake: Beat the frosting ingredients together until smooth and creamy. Stir in the pecans. Frost the (completely cooled) cake.
        </li>
    </ol>
